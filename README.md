## üß© Project Logic

### 1. **Question Types**
- All questions inherit from an abstract `Question` class.
- Each question type (`TrueOrFalseQuestion`, `ChooseOneAnswer`, `ChooseMultipleAnswer`) implements its own logic for displaying the question and checking answers.

### 2. **Exam Flow**
- Exams are created with a subject, a list of questions, and a time limit.
- Two main exam types:
  - **PracticeExam:** For self-assessment.
  - **FinalExam:** For official evaluation.
- Students are notified when an exam starts via event handling.

### 3. **Student Interaction**
- Students select the exam type.
- The system displays questions and collects answers.
- Results are processed and displayed at the end.

### 4. **File Management**
- Questions and exam attempts are logged to text files for persistence.
